# Radar - Modern Event Ticketing Platform

Radar is a comprehensive event ticketing platform designed to streamline event management and ticket purchasing. Built with modern web technologies, it provides a seamless experience for event organizers, students, and administrators.

The PIN module provides functionality for managing Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) for organizers in the Radar system. It handles PIN creation, storage, and recovery operations with secure password hashing.

- **Framework:** [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) with App Router
- **Language:** React 19.2
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **UI Components:** Custom components + [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) primitives
- **Icons:** [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)
- **State Management:** [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)
- **Animations:** [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- **HTTP Client:** [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) with interceptors for auth
- **Authentication:** Google OAuth + JWT
- **Forms:** [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- **Notifications:** [React Hot Toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/)
- **Theme:** Dark/Light mode with [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes)

**Features:**
- Automatic password hashing on save using Django's `make_password`
- Prevents double-hashing by checking if PIN is already hashed
- String representation returns email and PIN

**Example:**
```python
from radar.PIN.models import Pin

# Create a new PIN
pin = Pin.objects.create(
    Email='organizer@example.com',
    pin='1234'
)
# PIN is automatically hashed before saving
```

## API Endpoints

### 1. Create/Set PIN

**Endpoint:** `POST /pin/`

**Description:** Creates or updates a PIN for an organizer. The organizer must exist in the system.

**Request Body:**

{
    "Email": "organizer@example.com",
    "pin": "1234"
}
```

**Success Response (201 Created):**
```json
{
    "Message": "PIN saved successfully!"
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `400 Bad Request`: If organizer does not exist or validation fails
  ```json
  {
      "Message": "Organizer does not exist"
  }
  ```

**Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/pin/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"Email": "organizer@example.com", "pin": "1234"}'
```

### 2. Forgot PIN

**Endpoint:** `POST /forgot-pin/`

**Description:** Initiates the PIN recovery process by sending a PIN change link to the organizer's email.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
    "Email": "organizer@example.com"
}
```

**Success Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
    "message": "PIN change link sent to email.",
    "email": "organizer@example.com"
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `400 Bad Request`: If organizer does not exist
  ```json
  {
      "Message": "Organizer does not exist"
  }
  ```
- `500 Internal Server Error`: If email sending fails
  ```json
  {
      "error": "Failed to send PIN change email. Please try again."
  }
  ```

**Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/forgot-pin/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"Email": "organizer@example.com"}'
```

**Notes:**
- Sends an email with a redirect link to the change-pin endpoint
- Uses OTP generation (6-digit random number)
- Logs email sending status for debugging
